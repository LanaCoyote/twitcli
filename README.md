# TwitCLI
This is a twitter CLI program. It provides a streaming display of new tweets.

And yeah, "clitter" would have been a way better name but is questionably explicit.

# Requirements
 - Node.js
 - A bunch of dependencies

# Installation
 - Run `npm install` to get the latest dependencies
 - Copy config.js.template and enter your twitter secrets in there
 - Run `node app.js` to start it
 - Cross your fingers

# Some notes
I haven't tested this on Windows or extensively at all and it's probably broken. You have been warned!
